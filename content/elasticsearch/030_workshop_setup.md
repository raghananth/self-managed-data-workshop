### Create a Cloud9 environment

AWS Cloud9 comes with a terminal that includes sudo privileges to the managed Amazon EC2 instance that is hosting your development environment and a preauthenticated AWS Command Line Interface. This makes it easy for you to quickly run commands and directly access AWS services.

Create the Cloud9 environment

### Setup region

All of the workshop will be run in a particular region. Set the **REGION** variable to use in further commands.

```bash
export REGION=<your region>
```

### Setup a S3 bucket

The workshop will use CloudFormation templates to create the AWS resources. The CloudFormation templates will be uploaded to this S3 bucket.

```bash
aws s3 mb s3://<your bucket name> --region $REGION
aws s3 ls
```
The last command should display all of the S3 buckets in this region. Set the **BUCKET_NAME** variable to <your bucket name> to use in further commands.

```bash
export BUCKET_NAME=<your bucket name>
```
