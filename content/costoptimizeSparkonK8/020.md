## Connect to EKS cluster

Before running any commands against a new EKS cluster, you need to connect to it first. Get the connection command from your deployment output, something like this:

```
aws eks update-kubeconfig --name <EKS_cluster_name> --region <region> --role-arn arn:aws:iam::<account_number>:role/<role_name>
```
