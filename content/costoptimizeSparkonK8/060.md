## Clean up
* Delete the s3 bucket with a prefix of `sparkoneks-appcode`, because AWS CloudFormation cannot delete a non-empty bucket automatically. 
* Delete Application Load Balancer.
* Delete the Arc docker image from ECR.
* Finally, delete the rest of cloud resources via CDK CLI

```
cdk destroy SparkOnEKS -c env=develop --require-approval never
```
